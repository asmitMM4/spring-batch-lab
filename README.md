# About this repo

I want this repo to be a one-stop shop for Spring Batch users. It contains all my work related to Spring Batch:

* `issues`: [minimal complete examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to (try to) reproduce issues reported on Github and StackOverflow
* `diagrams`: UML diagrams generated from the source code of Spring Batch to help understand class hierarchies
* `samples`: Additional samples to complement the [official ones](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/tree/master/spring-batch-samples)
* `talks`: Code and slides of my talks on Spring Batch
* `templates`: Template projects I use to quickly create and prototype new projects
* `sandbox`: Draft ideas related to Spring Batch that will probably be never finished or implemented
* `blog`: Blog posts related to Spring Batch or batch processing in general. Those are written as issues to allow you to add reactions/comments.
